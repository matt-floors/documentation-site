Information can be real-time data collected in the PI System, configuration parameters and asset meta-data, documentation (pdf, images, etc..) or contextualized links to resources on other systems (SAP, etc.) Several PI Widgets from e-matica are available and more will be developed. Have a PI Vision graphical integration need? Just ask e-matica and you'll be all set!"
